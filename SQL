Based on Source data , count records as good and bad  from two tables

select b.source, 
count(a.employee_guid),
sum(case when a.home_code like "S%" then 1 else 0 end) as hs,
sum(case when a.work_code like "S%" then 1 else 0 end) as ws
from any_address_table as a
inner join
any_employee_table as b 
on a.employee_guid=b.employee_guid and a.yyyymm=b.yyyymm
where a.yyyymm='201807' and (a.home_code is not null or a.work_code is not null)
group by b.source
order by b.source
